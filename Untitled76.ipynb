    "Q1: Clustering is the process of grouping similar data points into clusters. Applications include market segmentation, image segmentation, anomaly detection, and social network analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) identifies clusters based on density. Unlike k-means, it doesn't require specifying the number of clusters and can find arbitrarily shaped clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Determine optimal epsilon and minimum points in DBSCAN using methods like the k-distance graph or domain knowledge to identify suitable density thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4:DBSCAN handles outliers by classifying points that don't fit into any cluster as noise, thus effectively separating them from the main clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: DBSCAN differs from k-means by identifying clusters based on density rather than distance from centroids, allowing it to find non-spherical clusters and handle noise more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: DBSCAN can be applied to high-dimensional datasets, but challenges include increased computational complexity and difficulty in choosing suitable distance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: DBSCAN handles clusters with varying densities by using a density threshold (epsilon) and a minimum number of points, allowing for different cluster densities within the same dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8:Common evaluation metrics for DBSCAN include silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, and cluster purity to assess cluster quality and compactness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9: DBSCAN is primarily unsupervised but can be adapted for semi-supervised tasks by incorporating labeled data points to guide clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10: DBSCAN handles noise by labeling it as outliers. Missing values need to be preprocessed, as DBSCAN requires complete data for distance calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11: Hereâ€™s an implementation of DBSCAN in Python:\n",

    "db = DBSCAN(eps=3, min_samples=2).fit(X)\n",
    "labels = db.labels_\n",

    "Discussion and Interpretation:\n",
    "- The plot visualizes the clustering results, with different colors representing different clusters.\n",
    "- Cluster -1 contains noise points that don't belong to any cluster.\n",
    "- The identified clusters show how DBSCAN effectively groups nearby points based on density."
